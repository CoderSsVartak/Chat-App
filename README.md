# Chat-App
It is a GUI based Chatting Application built using JAVA SWING and core JAVA.
The app uses data structures to store the user information like login and password which can be integrated with the database in order to use the application on a large scale.
The Project is just a working prototype of a chatting application. 
For an actual chatting application connect it to a database and use sockets for users to communicate.
The advantage of this application is that it doesnt use a server to store the messages and hence the message retrieval is fast.
